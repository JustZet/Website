* 🔑 Login, Create an account, and Disconnect methods. <br> 
* 💫 Dinamically user interaction. <br>

### 🍎 Installation:
* First of all you'll need to install <a 
href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">**xampp**<a> for execute php code and create database.
 
 
* After you installed xampp, you'll need to start 
  - **Apache** - This will help you to execute php code.
  - **MySQL** - This will help you to use database.
 
* After that you are able to create database. 
  - On [XAMPP Control Panel](https://imag.malavida.com/mvimgbig/download-fs/xampp-6688-1.jpg) click on **Admin** at **MySQL** row.
  - Create a database, don't worry! I saved mysql source code for create database [**here**](database/database.sql).
