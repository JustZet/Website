<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Hello! 
This is my first website! I used :<br> 
 • HTML for organizing the page format, <br> 
 • CSS to give a nice look,  <br> 
 • MySql for create and configurate a database, <br> 
 • PHP for create a user interaction with database, <br> 
 • JavaScript to create dinamicaly interaction. :shipit: <br> 
Is connected with a database named "Index", have one table named "website". <br>
