<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Hello! 
This is my first website! I used :
 <ul> HTML for organizing the page format, </ul>
 <ul> CSS to give a nice look,  </ul>
 <ul> MySql for create and configurate a database,  </ul> 
 <ul> PHP for create a user interaction with database,  </ul> 
 <ul> JavaScript to create dinamicaly interaction. :shipit: <br> 
Is connected with a database named "Index", have one table named "website". <br> </ul>
